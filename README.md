### TASK 1: Product Performance in the last 12 months

 - üìå **Requirement:** What are the top-performing subcategories in terms of quantity, sales value, and order quantity in the last 12 months?

 -  üéØ **Analytical Purpose:** To evaluate product performance by subcategory over the past year. This helps identify high-performing product lines and provides direction for marketing, inventory, and sales strategy.

 -  üìù**SQL Query:**

```sql
WITH max_date AS (
      SELECT DATE (MAX(ModifiedDate)) AS latest_date
      FROM `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail`)
SELECT 
  FORMAT_DATETIME ('%b %Y',a.ModifiedDate ) AS period
  ,c.Name 
  ,SUM(a.OrderQty) as qty_item
  ,SUM (a.LineTotal) as total_sales
  , COUNT (DISTINCT a.SalesOrderID) as order_qty 
FROM `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail` AS a
LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.Product` as b
    ON a.ProductID= b.ProductID
LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.ProductSubcategory` AS c
    ON CAST (b.ProductSubcategoryID AS INT) = c.ProductSubcategoryID 
WHERE DATE(a.ModifiedDate) >= (
  SELECT DATE_SUB(latest_date, INTERVAL 12 MONTH)
  FROM max_date)
GROUP BY period, c.Name 
ORDER BY period DESC, c.Name;
```
 -  üìã**Query Explanation:**

    - **Step 1 (CTE - max_date):**
    
     **Find the latest date** in the SalesOrderDetail table. This ensures that the ‚Äúlast 12 months‚Äù range is dynamic and **based on actual data**.
    
      - **Step 2 (Main Query):**
    
      Joins the `Sales.SalesOrderDetail` table with:
    
      `Production.Product`: to get the `ProductSubcategoryID`
    
      `Production.ProductSubcategory`: to get the readable subcategory Name
    
      Filters records to only include those in the last 12 months, based on `ModifiedDate`.
    
      Aggregates results:
    
        SUM(OrderQty) ‚Üí total quantity of items sold per subcategory.
    
        SUM(LineTotal) ‚Üí total revenue generated.
    
        COUNT(DISTINCT SalesOrderID) ‚Üí number of unique orders.
    
      Formats the ModifiedDate into a readable month-year string (e.g., "Oct 2013").

```sql
WITH data_raw AS (
  SELECT 
    EXTRACT(year FROM a.ModifiedDate) AS year,
    c.Name,
    SUM(a.OrderQty) AS Qty_item
  FROM `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail` AS a
  LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Sales.Product` AS b
    ON a.ProductID = b.ProductID
  LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.ProductSubcategory` AS c
    ON CAST(b.ProductSubcategoryID AS INT) = c.ProductSubcategoryID 
  GROUP BY 1, 2
),
diff_cte AS (
  SELECT 
    year,
    name,
    Qty_item,
    LAG(Qty_item) OVER (PARTITION BY Name ORDER BY year) AS prv_qty,
    ROUND((Qty_item / LAG(Qty_item) OVER (PARTITION BY Name ORDER BY year) - 1), 2) AS qty_diff
  FROM data_raw
),
rank_cte AS (
  SELECT 
    name,
    Qty_item,
    prv_qty,
    qty_diff,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY qty_diff DESC) AS rank
  FROM diff_cte
  ORDER BY rank 
)
SELECT 
  name,
  Qty_item,
  prv_qty,
  qty_diff
FROM rank_cte
WHERE rank <= 3;
```
 -  üìã**Query Explanation:**

   `data_raw` CTE: Aggregates yearly sales quantity (OrderQty) for each subcategory.
   
   `diff_cte`: Calculates previous year's quantity using the LAG() function and computes the YoY growth rate (qty_diff).
   
   `rank_cte`: Ranks the subcategories by highest YoY growth using DENSE_RANK().
   
   Final SELECT: Filters and returns only the top 3 subcategories with the highest growth rates.

   - These products may benefit from increased marketing efforts or inventory planning to sustain growth momentum.
---
### TASK 3: Top Territories

- üìå **Requirement:** Identify the top 3 `TerritoryIDs` with the highest total order quantity (OrderQty) for each year.

  - Use ranking by year.

  - If multiple TerritoryIDs have the same order_cnt, do not skip rank numbers (use DENSE_RANK()).



 -  üéØ **Analytical Purpose:** This analysis helps the business understand which sales territories are consistently performing well year over year, allowing management to:

    - Identify top-performing regions.
    
    - Allocate resources effectively.
    
    - Benchmark lower-performing regions.

 -  üìù**SQL Query:**
   ```sql
WITH total_qty as (-- T√≠nh t·ªïng Order theo nƒÉm v√† Territory
      SELECT 
              EXTRACT(year FROM a.ModifiedDate) AS year
            ,b.TerritoryID
            , SUM(a.OrderQty) AS order_cnt
      FROM `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail` AS a
      LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderHeader` AS b
          ON a.SalesOrderID = b.SalesOrderID
      GROUP BY 1,2) 
, rank_cte as ( --S·∫Øp x·∫øp k·∫øt qu·∫£ theo t·ª´ng nƒÉm 
    SELECT *
      , DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY  year   ORDER BY  order_cnt DESC) as rank 
    FROM total_qty
    ORDER BY year DESC)

SELECT 
  *
FROM rank_cte
WHERE  rank <=3;
```

 -  üìã**Query Explanation:**

    **Step 1:** total_qty CTE
    
    Extracts yearly total quantity of orders by each TerritoryID.
    
    Uses:
    
    EXTRACT(year FROM ModifiedDate) to pull out the year.
    
    SUM(a.OrderQty) to count the total ordered quantity.
    
    Joins SalesOrderDetail with SalesOrderHeader to get TerritoryID.
    
   **Step 2:** rank_cte
   
    Applies DENSE_RANK() to assign rankings within each year based on order_cnt (total order quantity).
    
    DENSE_RANK() is used to avoid gaps in ranking when multiple TerritoryIDs have the same total quantity.
   
   **Step 3:** Final Output
   
   Filters for top 3 ranked territories per year using WHERE rank <= 3. 
   
 -   **Results Snapshot:**
<img width="559" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c7b250e-7819-4d71-803c-66474a58f4d1" />

 -   **üìä Observation:**

    Territory 4 was consistently ranked #1 across all years shown, especially in 2013 with 26,682 orders.

    There‚Äôs a noticeable decline in order quantity over years: e.g., Territory 4 went from 26,682 (2013) ‚Üí 11,632 (2014).
    
    Top 3 ranks are correctly retained for each year, and the use of DENSE_RANK() ensures no skipped ranks when values tie.
    
    Useful for tracking regional sales performance trends and shifts over time

   - Support marketing and pricing strategy optimization for future discount campaigns.
     
 -  üìù**SQL Query:**
```sql
WITH data_raw as (
      SELECT 
              EXTRACT(year FROM a.ModifiedDate) AS year
              , c.Name
              , d.DiscountPct*a.UnitPrice*a.OrderQty as discount_cost
      FROM `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail` AS a
        LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Sales.Product` AS b
          ON a.ProductID = b.ProductID
        LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.ProductSubcategory` AS c
          ON CAST(b.ProductSubcategoryID AS INT) = c.ProductSubcategoryID 
        LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Sales.SpecialOffer` as d
          ON a.SpecialOfferID = d.SpecialOfferID 
      WHERE d.type = 'Seasonal Discount' )

SELECT 
  year
  , name 
  , SUM (discount_cost) as Total_cost_discount 
FROM data_raw
```
 -  üìã**Query Explanation:**

  **Step 1:** data_raw CTE
  Filters only records with a SpecialOffer.Type of "Seasonal Discount".
  
  Calculates the monetary value of the discount per order line:
  
  ini
  Sao ch√©p
  Ch·ªânh s·ª≠a
  discount_cost = DiscountPct √ó UnitPrice √ó OrderQty
  Extracts:
  
  The year from ModifiedDate to group data annually.
  
  The subcategory Name from the ProductSubcategory table.
  
** Step 2:** Final Aggregation
  Groups the data by year and subcategory name.
  
  Sums the discount_cost to compute total discount cost per subcategory per year.

    ORDER BY  a.CustomerID)

SELECT DISTINCT month_join, month_diff
  , COUNT (DISTINCT CustomerID ) AS customer_cnt
FROM all_join_cte
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 1;
```
 -  üìã**Query Explanation:**

`info_cte`:

Filters orders with status = 5 (Successfully Shipped) in 2014.

Extracts the month and year of each order.

Counts the number of distinct orders per customer per month.

`rank_month_cte`:

Assigns a row number to each month a customer made a purchase.

Helps us determine their first purchase month.

`first_month_purchase`:

Extracts the first month of purchase (rank_month = 1) for each customer.

This is treated as the cohort join month.

`all_join_cte`:

Joins the original monthly order data with the cohort month data.

Computes the difference in months between order month and first purchase month (e.g., M-0 for join month, M-1 for month after, etc.).

**Final SELECT:**

Groups by cohort month (month_join) and the time difference (month_diff).

Counts how many unique customers were active in each period relative to their first purchase month.

 -   **Results Snapshot:**

<img width="511" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd7b1747-7bdb-4b8f-b231-71b69f42caa6" />

 -   **üìä Observation:**

   **M-0 has the highest number of customers** (January: 2,076; February: 1,805; March: 1,918).

   Retention rate drops sharply after the first month, most customers only buy once.

   Some months (like M-3) have a slight increase, possibly due to quarterly promotions.

   Need to improve customer retention through loyalty program, reminder emails, periodic promotions.

  order by 1 desc 
)

select  Name
      , mth, yr 
      , stock_qty
      , stock_prv   
      , round(coalesce((stock_qty /stock_prv -1)*100 ,0) ,1) as diff   
from (                                                                 
      select *
      , lead (stock_qty) over (partition by Name order by mth desc) as stock_prv
      from raw_data
      )
order by 1 asc, 2 desc;
```

 -  üìã**Query Explanation:**

Step 1: CTE raw_data

Extracts the month and year from ModifiedDate.

Joins the WorkOrder and Product tables.

Aggregates stock quantities (StockedQty) by month and product.

Filters to include only records from 2011.

Step 2: Main Query

Uses LEAD() window function to fetch the stock quantity of the next month (to simulate comparing the current month to the previous one in descending order).

Computes the MoM % change with the formula
COALESCE(..., 0) is used to handle NULL values where no previous month exists.

 -   **Results Snapshot:**
<img width="881" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08e2806e-5214-4f83-993e-64cec1a6325b" />
