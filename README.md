# üìÅ Dataset Description & Data Structure

## üìå Data Source 

- **Source**: AdventureWorks 2019 Database is provided by Microsoft

- üè¢ **Overview of AdventureWorks 2019**

  - Database Type: **Relational database**

  - Context: Simulates a consumer goods manufacturing company named Adventure Works Cycles, which specializes in selling bicycles and related accessories.

  - Version: The 2019 edition is updated to align with the latest SQL Server standards, supporting features like temporal tables, graph tables, and more.
  
- **Tables Used:** 7 tables included `Sales.SalesOrderDetail`, `Sales.SalesOrderHeader`, `Sales.SpecialOffer`, `Production.Product`,` Production.ProductSubcategory`, `Production.WorkOrder`, `Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader`

-  **Data Sources Description:**

The analysis is based on the AdventureWorks 2019 database. Key tables and their purposes are summarized as follows:

|Table Name	|Description|
| :--- | :--- |
|`Sales.SalesOrderDetail`|Contains detailed information about each product in an order, including quantity, unit price, and discounts. Used to analyze product-level sales performance.|
|`Sales.SalesOrderHeader`|Stores general order information such as customer ID, order date, status, and total due. Supports order-level analysis and filtering by time, region, or status.|
|`Sales.SpecialOffer`|Describes promotional offers, such as discount type. Used to analyze the impact of discounts on sales.|
|`Production.Product`|Provides attributes of each product, including name, standard cost, and list price. Helps link product performance with pricing and classification.|
|`Production.ProductSubcategory`|Groups products into subcategories (e.g., Mountain Bikes, Road Bikes). Supports subcategory-level sales performance and growth tracking.|
|`Production.WorkOrder`|Tracks the production of items, including start and end dates, quantities, and product IDs. Used in inventory flow and production timeline analysis.|
|`Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader`|Stores purchase order data related to inventory replenishment. Includes order date, status, vendor, and total amount. Supports inventory planning and stock analysis.|

**üí° Notes:** Tables are joined primarily via `ProductID`, `SalesOrderID`, 'SpecialOfferID`, and `ProductSubcategoryID`, depending on the context.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preparation (Cleaning & Processing) 

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### SQL Analysis Tasks:

#### TASK 1: Product Performance 
 - üìå **Requirement:** What are the top-performing subcategories in terms of quantity, sales value, and order quantity in the last 12 months?

 -  üéØ **Analytical Purpose:** To evaluate product performance by subcategory over the past year. This helps identify high-performing product lines and provides direction for marketing, inventory, and sales strategy.

 -  üìù**SQL Query:**

```sql
WITH max_date AS (
      SELECT DATE (MAX(ModifiedDate)) AS latest_date
      FROM `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail`)
SELECT 
  FORMAT_DATETIME ('%b %Y',a.ModifiedDate ) AS period
  ,c.Name 
  ,SUM(a.OrderQty) as qty_item
  ,SUM (a.LineTotal) as total_sales
  , COUNT (DISTINCT a.SalesOrderID) as order_qty 
FROM `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail` AS a
LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.Product` as b
    ON a.ProductID= b.ProductID
LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.ProductSubcategory` AS c
    ON CAST (b.ProductSubcategoryID AS INT) = c.ProductSubcategoryID 
WHERE DATE(a.ModifiedDate) >= (
  SELECT DATE_SUB(latest_date, INTERVAL 12 MONTH)
  FROM max_date)
GROUP BY period, c.Name 
ORDER BY period DESC, c.Name;
```
 -  üìã**Query Explanation:**

    - **Step 1 (CTE - max_date):**
    
      Find the latest date in the SalesOrderDetail table. This ensures that the ‚Äúlast 12 months‚Äù range is dynamic and based on actual data.
    
      - **Step 2 (Main Query):**
    
      Joins the `Sales.SalesOrderDetail` table with:
    
      `Production.Product`: to get the `ProductSubcategoryID`
    
      `Production.ProductSubcategory`: to get the readable subcategory Name
    
      Filters records to only include those in the last 12 months, based on `ModifiedDate`.
    
      Aggregates results:
    
        SUM(OrderQty) ‚Üí total quantity of items sold per subcategory.
    
        SUM(LineTotal) ‚Üí total revenue generated.
    
        COUNT(DISTINCT SalesOrderID) ‚Üí number of unique orders.
    
      Formats the ModifiedDate into a readable month-year string (e.g., "Oct 2013").

# üìä Final Conclusion & Recommendations

Top Subcategories & Growth: Subcategories with the highest growth should be prioritized for marketing campaigns. Slow-growing categories may require product improvements or promotions.


Top Territories: Focusing on the top 3 performing territories each year can help identify best practices for expansion.


Seasonal Discount Optimization: Evaluate the impact of seasonal discounts to ensure they generate sufficient sales without excessive costs.


Customer Retention: Enhance customer loyalty programs to maintain a high retention rate.


Stock Management: Ensure sufficient stock for fast-moving products while avoiding overstocking of slow-moving items.
